# disposable-email-providers
An aggregate list of all providers of disposable email domains for anti-spam self-defense.

## How was this list made?
It was aggregated from various lists I have found around the internet, as well as new ones I discover in the field.

## Know of more?
Please make a pull request. I generally respond within 24 hours, if not in less than 15 minutes. Most other efforts seem to have been abandoned, so I'm trying to keep this one as up-to-date as possible.

## How do I get my domain removed from this list?
Make a pull request and include proof that your domain does not give out disposable email addresses. Simple as that.
